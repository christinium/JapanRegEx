Brief Hospital Course:
# HTN: Hypertensive with SBP in 190s initially, attributed to
DKA. As she improved, her blood pressures normalized and she 
was re-started on her home Lopressor and Midodrine regimen.

# Coffee grounds emesis: Emesis started off as clear, then with
prolonged wretching, she started having coffee-grounds vomiting.
This had also occurred on prior admissions for DKA with
associated vomiting. Her hematocrit remained stable and her
hematemesis self-resolved.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease, Stage III: Patient's creatinine on
admission was 2.7, trending down to 2.1-2.3 following fluids,
consistent with her known CKD secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
